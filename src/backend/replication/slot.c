 *
 * NOTES
 *
 * Replication slots are used to keep state about replication streams
 * originating from this cluster.  Their primary purpose is to prevent the
 * premature removal of WAL or of old tuple versions in a manner that would
 * interfere with replication; they are also useful for monitoring purposes.
 * Slots need to be permanent (to allow restarts), crash-safe, and allocatable
 * on standbys (to support cascading setups).  The requirement that slots be
 * usable on standbys precludes storing them in the system catalogs.
 *
 * Each replication slot gets its own directory inside the $PGDATA/pg_replslot
 * directory. Inside that directory the state file will contain the slot's
 * own data. Additional data can be stored alongside that file if required.
 * While the server is running, the state data is also cached in memory for
 * efficiency. Non-failover slots are NOT subject to WAL logging and may
 * be used on standbys (though that's only supported for physical slots at
 * the moment). They use tempfile writes and swaps for crash safety.
 *
 * A failover slot created on a master node generates WAL records that
 * maintain a copy of the slot on standby nodes. If a standby node is
 * promoted the failover slot allows access to be restarted just as if the
 * the original master node was being accessed, allowing for the timeline
 * change. The replica considers slot positions when removing WAL to make
 * sure it can satisfy the needs of slots after promotion.  For logical
 * decoding slots the slot's internal state is kept up to date so it's
 * ready for use after promotion.
 *
 * ReplicationSlotAllocationLock must be taken in exclusive mode to allocate
 * or free a slot. ReplicationSlotControlLock must be taken in shared mode
 * to iterate over the slots, and in exclusive mode to change the in_use flag
 * of a slot.  The remaining data in each slot is protected by its mutex.

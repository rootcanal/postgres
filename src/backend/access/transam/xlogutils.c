/*
 * XLogReadBufferForRedo
 *		Read a page during XLOG replay
 *
 * Reads a block referenced by a WAL record into shared buffer cache, and
 * determines what needs to be done to redo the changes to it.  If the WAL
 * record includes a full-page image of the page, it is restored.
 *
 * 'lsn' is the LSN of the record being replayed.  It is compared with the
 * page's LSN to determine if the record has already been replayed.
 * 'block_id' is the ID number the block was registered with, when the WAL
 * record was created.
 *
 * Returns one of the following:
 *
 *	BLK_NEEDS_REDO	- changes from the WAL record need to be applied
 *	BLK_DONE		- block doesn't need replaying
 *	BLK_RESTORED	- block was restored from a full-page image included in
 *					  the record
 *	BLK_NOTFOUND	- block was not found (because it was truncated away by
 *					  an operation later in the WAL stream)
 *
 * On return, the buffer is locked in exclusive-mode, and returned in *buf.
 * Note that the buffer is locked and returned even if it doesn't need
 * replaying.  (Getting the buffer lock is not really necessary during
 * single-process crash recovery, but some subroutines such as MarkBufferDirty
 * will complain if we don't have the lock.  In hot standby mode it's
 * definitely necessary.)
 *
 * Note: when a backup block is available in XLOG, we restore it
 * unconditionally, even if the page in the database appears newer.  This is
 * to protect ourselves against database pages that were partially or
 * incorrectly written during a crash.  We assume that the XLOG data must be
 * good because it has passed a CRC check, while the database page might not
 * be.  This will force us to replay all subsequent modifications of the page
 * that appear in XLOG, rather than possibly ignoring them as already
 * applied, but that's not a huge drawback.

/*
 * XLogReadBufferExtended
 *		Read a page during XLOG replay
 *
 * This is functionally comparable to ReadBufferExtended. There's some
 * differences in the behavior wrt. the "mode" argument:
 *
 * In RBM_NORMAL mode, if the page doesn't exist, or contains all-zeroes, we
 * return InvalidBuffer. In this case the caller should silently skip the
 * update on this page. (In this situation, we expect that the page was later
 * dropped or truncated. If we don't see evidence of that later in the WAL
 * sequence, we'll complain at the end of WAL replay.)
 *
 * In RBM_ZERO_* modes, if the page doesn't exist, the relation is extended
 * with all-zeroes pages up to the given block number.
 *
 * In RBM_NORMAL_NO_LOG mode, we return InvalidBuffer if the page doesn't
 * exist, and we don't check for all-zeroes.  Thus, no log entry is made
 * to imply that the page should be dropped or truncated later.
 *
 * NB: A redo function should normally not call this directly. To get a page
 * to modify, use XLogReplayBuffer instead. It is important that all pages
 * modified by a WAL record are registered in the WAL records, or they will be
 * invisible to tools that that need to know which pages are modified.
